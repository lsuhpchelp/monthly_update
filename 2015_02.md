##### Some pacckages for high-energy physics develped by CERN

* CLHEP

CLHEP (short for A Class Library for High Energy Physics) is a C++ library that
provides utility classes for general numerical programming, vector arithmetic,
geometry, pseudorandom number generation, and linear algebra, specifically targeted
for high energy physics simulation and analysis software.

Softenv key: +clhep-2.1.4.2-gcc-4.4.6

* GEANT4

Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter.
Its areas of application include high energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, as
well as studies in medical and space science.

Softenv key: +geant-4.10.00.p02-gcc-4.4.6

* ROOT

ROOT is an object-oriented program and library developed by CERN. It was originally
designed for particle physics data analysis and contains several features specific
to this field, but it is also used in other applications such as astronomy and data
mining.

Softenv key: +root-5.34.23-gcc-4.4.6

* GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission)

Softenv key: +gate-7.0-gcc-4.4.6
